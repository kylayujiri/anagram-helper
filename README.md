# Anagram Helper

For when you want to solve the anagram yourself&mdash;not have it solved for you.

There are two ways to view the shuffled letters: in a line and in a circle. Toggle between them by pressing the button in the upper right corner.

To lock a letter so it does not shuffle, click on the letter tile. Locked letters will stay in the position they were locked in. Unlock them by clicking on the tile again.

## Inspiration

I recently learned how to solve cryptic crosswords and started trying to solve the [New Yorker's cryptic crosswords](https://www.newyorker.com/puzzles-and-games-dept/cryptic-crossword/reintroducing-the-new-yorkers-cryptic-crossword).

Many cryptic clues require you to solve an anagram. Instead of writing the letters out on a piece of paper and shuffling the letters manually, I wanted a tool to shuffle them for me. However, I didn't just want the answer to be given to me like the anagram solvers you can find online (that's no fun!). I want to find the anagram myself!
